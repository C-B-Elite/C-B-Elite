### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- I'm Essen, a developer with a primary focus on Rust and Blockchain. I graduated from Northeastern University in China, majoring in Software Engineering with a specialization in Information Security.
- Previously, I worked as a security development engineer on Ethereum and contributed to the publication of the book "CTFå®žæˆ˜ï¼šæŠ€æœ¯ï¼Œè§£é¢˜ä¸Žè¿›é˜¶" as the main author of the chapter on smart contract security.
- Later, I participated in the expansion of the ICP blockchain ecosystem, serving as an ICP blockchain technology ambassador, core developer for storage DApps, and co-founder of an NFT Marketplace.
- I have a strong passion for Rust and continually use it to build applications and protocols such as Infura. Currently, I'm focusing on the ZK and DA directions and developing applications and protocols within these two domains.
